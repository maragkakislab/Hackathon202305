# Hackathon202305
Our first hackathon!

# When:
Monday May 22 is the Neural Network workshop

Tuesday May 23 is the Hackathon

10am to when our food runs out.

# The what:
For each gene, we want to be able to predict its decay rate, i.e. half-life or equivalent measures, using propoerties of genes.

# Validation data:
We have half-life measurements from the following sources:
- mmu 3T3 cells from Eisen et al <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.12.005>
- mmu ESC from Sharova et al <https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsn030> 
- hsa HeLa from Tani et al <https://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/5/947.full>
- hsa various from Tani's Supplementary Tables

# Features:
## From Ensembl:
- Gene lengths

## From the lab:
- mmu 3T3: one MION one PION
- hsa HeLa

Getting:
- Expression data
- Slide parameters: Proportion of full-length reads, max poly(A)-tail length

# Misc tips:
- Open drinks need to be two spill distances away from any computer
